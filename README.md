# ReactNativeMobileApp
Mobile app designed for neighborhoods to better engage with their local communitites. Some features include joining a group based off of local zip codes as well as group chats and event planners. There is also the ability to use google maps api markers to mark issues in the neighborhood and have them visible for others in the group to see.
